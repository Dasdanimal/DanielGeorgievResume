        <br>Private Prison Profiteering
	Roughly two point twelve million people are imprisoned in the United States at this moment. Thirty seven of the fifty states in the US have a higher incarceration rate per one hundred thousand people than any other country in the world, the other seventeen are only beaten out by a handful of countries. Why does a nation, who prides itself on its forward thinking and societal innovation, have such a large number of its population, roughly two point eight percent, under correctional supervision? The short answer: it is because they are encouraged to. With the rising number of incarcerations the United States government has turned to private corporations to assist in managing inmates. However, this privatization of the penal system incentivises construction and operating practices that compromise the reformation, rehabilitation, and safety of the inmates.

	The first thing to note is that these new types of prisons are, obviously, private. But what this really means is that they are for-profit. The goal of the institutions in question is to make as much money as possible for its owner. This is not inherently a bad thing. The United States is built on private enterprise, and the for-profit mentality is a cornerstone in our culture that works quite well when the goals of both the private business and the consumer align. For example, if people want to buy delicious food, and a private food company wants to make money, then the company will find the cheapest way to make delicious food. It‚Äôs a win-win scenario. The issue arises when the goals do not align, which is the case for private prisons. The consumer‚Äôs goal, or inmate, is to serve their sentence and be rehabilitated for normal civilian life. The for-profit prison‚Äôs goal is inherently to make money, but it does not make money by rehabilitating prisoners. It makes money through government contracts, and the price of these contracts is determined by the number of inmates the prison takes on. As is apparent here, the goals of the inmates and the prisons do not align. Although the inmates want, relatively speaking, to be properly reformed for the outside world, the prisons only need to focus on the number of inmates they can house. This means that they have zero incentive to provide any programs or spend any money towards the purpose of inmate rehabilitation. 

Although the lack of reform doctrine is, in itself, a big enough disservice to the prison population, there is an even greater issue at hand, this issue being the fact that prisons are incentivised to create repeat offenders. From a moral perspective, this is obviously an awful thing that should never be an entity‚Äôs goal, but from a business perspective, this is perhaps the smartest thing these prisons could do to increase their business. In a for-profit prison every single empty bed is money lost, considering the fact that they still have to pay for the upkeep of the bed regardless of if there is an inmate occupying it or not. The prisons are then faced with the issue of how they can ensure that they fill all the beds they have available. The easiest solution is to just recycle old inmates. As long as a majority of the inmates released become repeat offenders then there will be a steady supply of ‚Äúcustomers‚Äù to fill their
